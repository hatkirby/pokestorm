# Pokémon Sandstorm Version

This is a silly romhack of Pokémon Ruby and Sapphire wherein the song Sandstorm by Darude plays in battles during sandstorms.

Currently it only plays for wild encounters that start where there is an overworld sandstorm. It does not start playing if a sandstorm is conjured in battle, and it does not stop playing if the sandstorm is ended by another weather effect.

To set up the repository, see [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md).
